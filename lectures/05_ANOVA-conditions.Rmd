## Review of last class

- Introduced the motivation behind the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- Data decomposition
- Computing the SS, MS, df, and F-ratio
- Inference for ANOVA (p-values)

## ANOVA for One-Way ANOVA

Model:

$${y}_{ij}=\mu+{\alpha}_{i}+{e}_{ij}$$

Null hypothesis:

$${H}_{0}:{\alpha}_{1}={\alpha}_{2}=...={\alpha}_{a}=0$$

ANOVA Source table:

| Source | SS | df | MS | F | 
|------:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|
| Treatment | $n\sum_{i=1}^{a}(\bar{y}_{i.}-\bar{y}_{..})^{2}$ | $a-1$ | $\frac{{SS}_{Treatments}}{{df}_{Treatments}}$ | $\frac{{MS}_{Treatments}}{{MS}_{E}}$ |
| Error | $\sum_{i=1}^{a}\sum_{j=1}^{n}({y}_{ij}-\bar{y}_{i.})^{2}$ | $N-a$ | $\frac{{SS}_{E}}{{df}_{E}}$ | |


## Running an ANOVA in R

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
leaf <- data.frame(diet = c("control","control","sucrose", "sucrose", "glucose", "glucose", "fructose","fructose"), days = c(2.3,1.7,3.6,4.0,2.9,2.7,2.1,2.3))
```

Three steps:

1. Boxplots or some data visualization
2. Descriptive statistics (n, means, standard deviations)
3. ANOVA
4. Check assumptions

## Step 1. Boxplots

```{r}
#Note that boxplots are a bit silly in this example because n is only 2.
qplot(x = diet, y = days, data = leaf, geom = "boxplot")
```

## Step 2. Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
leaf %>%
  group_by(diet) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            m = mean(days),
            sd = sd(days))
```

## Step 3. ANOVA

```{r}
mod <- lm(days ~ diet, data = leaf)
anova(mod)
```

### Write a sentence interpreting the One-Way ANOVA results

There are statistically significant differences in leafhopper survival rates across diets, $F(3, 4) = 17.42$, $p = .009$. 

**OR**

Diet has a statistically significant effect on leafhopper survival rates, $F(3, 4) = 17.42$, $p = .009$.

## Try it!

In groups of three run all three steps (visualize, descriptive stats, and ANOVA) for the two datasets below. Write a sentence about your conclusion from the ANOVA. 

**Dataset 1**: `SandwichAnts`

- Factor: `Bread`
- Response: `Ants`

**Dataset 2**: `Meniscus`

- Factor: `Method`
- Response: `Displacement`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(Stat2Data)
data("SandwichAnts")
?SandwichAnts
```

## ANOVA Conditions

**STOP!!**...only under certain conditions can we rely on this inference. There were many assumptions built into:

- how we decomposed the data, and 
- our thoughts about residual errors. 

### Simulation in R: Assembly Line Metaphor

![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/MelodicCalculatingBluejay.webp)

- Recall the [Assembly Line Metaphor code](https://randilgarcia.github.io/sds290fall21/lectures/02_informal_anova.Rmd)

## ANOVA Conditions

![](04_exp_decisions-figure/CA-SINZ2.png)

- **C**. Constant effects
- **A**. Additive effects
- **S**. Same standard deviations
- **I**. Independent residuals
- **N**. Normally distributed residuals
- **Z**. Zero mean residuals

## C. Constant effects

We assume every observation in a similar condition is affected exactly the same. (Gets the same "true score").

```{r, eval=FALSE}
animals_sim <- animals %>%
  mutate(benchmark = mean(calm)) %>%
  group_by(animal) %>%
  mutate(animal_mean = mean(calm),
         aminal_effect = animal_mean - benchmark)
```

## A. Additive effects

We add the effects as we go down the assembly line.

The interaction effect captures the possibility that conditions have non-additive effects, but it is also added to everything else.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
calm_sim = benchmark
         + aminal_effect
         + cue_effect
         + interaction_effect
         + student_effect
```

## S. Same standard deviations

The piece of code for adding error is not dependent on which condition the observations is in.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
 + rnorm(82, 0, 0.79)
```

## I. Independent residuals

Takes 82 independent draws from a normal distribution.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
 + rnorm(82, 0, 0.79)
```

## N. Normally distributed residuals

It's `rnorm()`, and not `rbinom()` or `rpois()`...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
 + rnorm(82, 0, 0.79)
```

## Z. Zero mean residuals

The second argument is the mean.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
 + rnorm(82, 0, 0.79)
```

## How to check assumptions

- C. **Constant effects** -- *think* about whether it is reasonable.

- A. **Additive effects** -- *think* about whether it is reasonable.

- S. **Same standard deviations** -- is the biggest SD less than two times as large as the smallest?

- I. **Independent residuals** -- *think* about whether it is reasonable.

- N. **Normally distributed residuals** -- construct a histogram or normal probability plot of residuals.

- Z. **Zero mean residuals** -- construct a histogram or normal probability plot of residuals.

## To check the Residual Assumptions: SINZ

**S**: calculate descriptive statistics and divide largest SD by smallest.

```{r}
leaf %>%
  group_by(diet) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            m = mean(days),
            sd = sd(days))

0.424/0.141
```

**I**: Judge for yourself -- what do we think about the leafhopper dishes?

## To check the Residual Assumptions: SINZ

**N**: Look at histogram and normal probability plots of residuals.

```{r}
#normal probability plot of residuals
plot(mod, which = 2)
```

## To check the Residual Assumptions: SINZ

**Z**: Look at histogram of residuals.

```{r}
#histogram of residuals
qplot(x = mod$residuals, bins = 4)
```

## Try it!

Back in your groups of three, check or discuss the last 4 ANOVA assumptions: The **SINZ**.

**Dataset 1**: `SandwichAnts`

- Factor: `Bread`
- Response: `Ants`

**Dataset 2**: `Meniscus`

- Factor: `Method`
- Response: `Displacement`
