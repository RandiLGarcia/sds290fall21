## 5.59c and sampling error

>**Question:** Explain why it's not sufficient to examine the four sample means, note that they all differ, and conclude that all races do have birth weight distributions that differ from each other. 

**Answer:** Because this is just one a sample from a population. If we collected another sample we would see slightly different mean birth weights for the four groups. We need to consider if the group differences we see in this sample are greater than the differences we would expect from sample to sample.
    
## Null Hypothesis Correction

$${H}_{0}:\mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3=\mu_4$$

*OR*, ${H}_{0}:\alpha_1=\alpha_2=\alpha_3=\alpha_4=0$

$${H}_{A}:some\:\mu_i\neq\mu_j$$

Or $H_a: Some\:\alpha_i\neq 0$. We can find the p-value for our F calculation with the following code

```{r, eval=FALSE}

pf(17.422, 3, 4, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

## Introduction to Qualtrics

- Log in to [Qualtrics](smithcollege.qualtrics.com) and enter your Smith credentials.
    - I usually just Google "Smith Qualtrics"
