\section*{Homework 6}

\begin{enumerate} 

\item Determine if the statements below are true or false, and explain your reasoning.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If a fair coin is tossed many times and the last eight tosses are all heads, then the chance that the next toss will be heads is somewhat less than 50\%.
\item Drawing a face card (jack, queen, or king) and drawing a red card from a full deck of playing cards are mutually exclusive events.
\item Drawing a face card and drawing an ace from a full deck of playing cards are mutually exclusive events.
\end{enumerate}

% \emph{
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item False. Since these are independent trials the probability does not change from trial to trial and does not depend on what the outcome was on the previous trial(s). Therefore, in the next toss the probability of getting a head will still be 0.5.
% \item False. There are red face cards (jack, queen, or king of hearts and diamonds). Since a card can be both a face card and a red card, the two events are not mutually exclusive.
% \item True. A card cannot be both a face card and an ace.
% \end{enumerate}}


\item If you flip a fair coin 10 times, what is the probability of
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item getting all tails? 
\item getting all heads? 
\item getting at least one tails? 
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

% \emph{
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item P(all tails) = $0.5^{10}$ = 0.00098.
% \item P(all heads) = $0.5^{10}$ = 0.00098.
% \item P(at least one tails) = 1 - P(no tails) = $1 - (0.5^{10}) \approx 1 - 0.001 = 0.999$.
% \end{enumerate}}


\item The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year to give communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The 2010 American Community Survey estimates than 14.6\% of Americans live below the poverty line, 20.7\% speak a language other that English at home, and 4.2\% fall into both categories.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Are living below the poverty line and speaking a language other than English at home disjoint?
\item Draw a Venn diagram summarizing the variables and their associated probabilities.
\item What percent of Americans live below the poverty line and only speak English at home?
\item What percent of Americans live below the poverty line or speak a language other than English at home?
\item What percent of Americans live above the poverty line and only speak English at home? 
\item Is the event that someone lives below the poverty line independent of the event that the person speaks a language other than English at home?
\end{enumerate}

% \emph{
% Poverty line: PL, language other the English at home: LOE
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item No, there are people who are both living below the poverty line and speak a language other than English at home.
% \item The Venn diagram is shown below.
% \begin{center}
% \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{poorLang}
% \end{center}
% \item Each person living below the poverty line either speaks only English at home or doesn't. Since 14.6\% of Americans live below the poverty line and 4.2\% speak a language other than English at home, the other 10.4\% only speak English at home.
% \item Using the General Addition Rule:
% \begin{align*}
% P(\text{below PL or speak LOE}) &= P(\text{below PL}) + P(\text{speak LOE}) - P(\text{both}) \\
% &= 0.146 + 0.207 - 0.042 = 0.311
% \end{align*}
% \item P(neither below PL nor speak LOE) = 1 - P(below PL or speak LOE)  = 1 - 0.311 = 0.689.
% \item $P(PL)\times P(LOE) = 0.146\times 0.207 = 0.030$, which does not equal $P(PL$ and $LOE) = 0.042$, so the events are dependent.
% \end{enumerate}}


\item The table below shows the distribution of education level attained by US residents by gender based on data collected during the 2010 American Community Survey.
\begin{center}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability that a randomly chosen man has at least a Bachelor's degree?
\item What is the probability that a randomly chosen woman has at least a Bachelor's degree?
\item What is the probability that a man and a woman getting married both have at least a Bachelor's degree? Note any assumptions you make.
\item If you made an assumption in part (c), do you think it was reasonable? If you didn't make an assumption, double check your earlier answer.
\end{enumerate}

% \emph{
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item P(at least a Bachelor's degree $|$ male) = 0.16 + 0.09 = 0.25
% \item P(at least a Bachelor's degree $|$ female) = 0.17 + 0.09 = 0.26
% \item Assuming that the education level of the husband and wife are independent: \\
% P(man and woman both have at least a Bachelor's degree) = 0.25 $\times$ 0.26 = 0.065
% \item The independence assumption may not be reasonable since people often marry others with a comparable level of education.
% \end{enumerate}}


\item Each row in the table below is a proposed grade distribution for a class. Identify each as a valid or invalid probability distribution, and explain your reasoning.
\begin{center}

\end{tabular}

% \emph{
% \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
% \setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
% \item Invalid. The sum of the probabilities is greater than 1 ($0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.2$).
% \item Valid. The probabilities are all between 0 and 1, and they sum to 1. In this class, every person gets a C!
% \item Invalid. The sum of the probabilities is less than 1 ($0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0 + 0 = 0.9$).
% \item Invalid. There is a negative probability listed (-0.1 for F).
% \item Valid. The probabilities are all between 0 and 1, and they sum to 1. In this distribution, 80\% of students get an A, B, or C.
% \item Invalid. There is a negative probability listed (-0.1 for B).
% \end{enumerate}}

\item Suppose 80\% of people like peanut butter, 89\% like jelly, and 78\% like both. Given that a randomly sampled person likes peanut butter, what's the probability that they like jelly?
% 
%  \[ P(J | PB) = \frac{P(PB~and~J)}{P(PB)} = \frac{0.78}{0.80} = 0.624 \]

\item A 2010 SurveyUSA poll asked 500 Los Angeles residents ``What is the best hamburger place in Southern California? Five Guys Burgers? In-N-Out Burger? Fat Burger? Tommy's Hamburgers? Umami Burger? Or somewhere else?". The distribution of responses by gender is shown below.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l p{4cm} r r r }
&  					& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Gender}} \\
\cline{3-4}
&								& Male	& Female 	& Total\\
\cline{2-5}
& Five Guys Burgers					&5		&6	 	& 11	\\
& In-N-Out Burger					&162	&181	& 343 \\
\textit{Best} & Fat Burger				&10		&12	 	& 22 \\
\textit{hamburger} & Tommy's Hamburgers	&27		&27	 	& 54	\\ 
\textit{place} & Umami Burger			&5		&1	 	& 6 \\
& Other							&26		&20	 	& 46 \\
& Not Sure						&13		&5	 	& 18 \\
\cline{2-5}
&Total							&248	&252	& 500
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability that a randomly chosen male likes In-N-Out the best?
\item What is the probability that a randomly chosen female likes In-N-Out the best?
\item What is the probability that a man and a woman who are dating both like In-N-Out the best? Note any assumption you make and evaluate whether you think that assumption is reasonable.
\item What is the probability that a randomly chosen person likes Umami best or that person is female or both?
\end{enumerate}

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item P(In-N-Out $|$ male) = 162 / 248 $\approx$ 0.65.
% \item P(In-N-Out $|$ female) = 181 / 252 $\approx$ 0.72.
% \item Under the assumption of independence of gender and hamburger preference: P(man and woman dating both like In-N-Out burgers the best) = 0.65 $\times$ 0.72 = 0.468. While it is possible there is some mysterious connection between burger choice and finding a partner, independence is probably a reasonable assumption.
% \item P(Umami or female) = P(Umami) + P(female) - P(Umami and female) = (6 / 500) + (252 / 500) - (1 / 500) = 0.514.
% \end{enumerate}

\item Swaziland has the highest HIV prevalence in the world. 25.9\% of this country's population is infected with HIV. The ELISA test is one of the first and most accurate tests for HIV. For those who carry HIV, the ELISA test is 99.7\% accurate. For those who do not carry HIV, the test is 92.6\% accurate. If an individual from Swaziland has tested positive, what is the probability that he carries HIV?

% \begin{center}
% You might see trees or tables used to solve this problem.  Here's the table:
% \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{tree_swazilandHIV}
% \end{center}
% 
% \[ P(HIV | +) = \frac{P(HIV~and~+)}{P(+)} = \frac{0.259 \times 0.997}{0.259 \times 0.997 + (1 - 0.259) \times (1 - 0.926)}= \frac{0.2582}{0.3131} = 0.8247 \]

\item An airline charges the following baggage fees: \$25 for the first bag and \$35 for the second. Suppose 54\% of passengers have no checked luggage, 34\% have one piece of checked luggage and 12\% have two pieces. We suppose a negligible portion of people check more than two bags.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Build a probability model, compute the average revenue per passenger, and compute the corresponding standard deviation.
\item About how much revenue should they expect for a flight of 120 passengers? With what standard deviation? Note any assumptions you make and if you think they are justified.
\end{enumerate}

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item The probability model and the calculation of average revenue per passenger (expected value) are as follows:
% \begin{center}
% \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
% \begin{tabular} {l | l | l | l | l | l}
% Event   				& X	& P(X)	& X $\cdot$ P(X) 	& $(X - E(X))^2$			& $(X - E(X))^2 \cdot P(X)$ \\
% \hline
% No baggage 				& 0	& 0.54	& 0			& $(0 - 15.70)^2 = 246.49 $	& $246.49 \times 0.54 = 133.10$  \\
% 1 checked bag				& 25	& 0.34	& 8.5 		& $(25 - 15.70)^2 = 86.49 $	& $86.49 \times 0.34 = 29.41$ \\
% 2 checked bags			& 60	& 0.12	& 7.2 		& $(60 - 15.70)^2 = 1962.49 $	& $1962.49 \times 0.12 = 235.50$ \\
% \hline
% 						&	&		& E(X) = \$15.70	&	& V(X) = \$398.01 \\
% \multicolumn{5}{l |}{}  										& $SD(X) = \sqrt{V(X)} = \$19.95$
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% \item We assume independence between individual fliers. This probably is not exactly correct, but it would provide a helpful first approximation for the true revenue.
% \begin{align*}
% E(X_1 + \cdots + X_{120}) &=  E(X_1) + \cdots + E(X_{120}) = 120 \times 15.70 = \$1,884 \\
% V(X_1 + \cdots + X_{120}) &=  V(X_1) + \cdots + V(X_{120}) = 120 \times 398.01 = \$47,761.20 \\
% SD(X_1 + \cdots + X_{120}) &= \sqrt{47,761.20} = \$218.54
% \end{align*}
